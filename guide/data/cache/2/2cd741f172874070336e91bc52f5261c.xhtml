Most of the Conzept interface can be localized, these parts include main UI elements such as menu labels and the topic-card section names.
</p>

<p>
The list of supported locales can be found in the Conzept settings file (“CONZEPT_LOCALES”). Conzept also has basic support for right-to-left scripts such as Arabic.

<p>
If you want to add a new locale to Conzept, you first to add it to the settings file and then add a new locale file in the “<a href="https://github.com/waldenn/conzept/tree/master/app/explore2/assets/i18n" class="urlextern" title="https://github.com/waldenn/conzept/tree/master/app/explore2/assets/i18n" rel="ugc nofollow">app/explore2/assets/i18n</a>” directory.
</p>

<p>
The easiest way to do this is to copy the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/waldenn/conzept/master/app/explore2/assets/i18n/conzept-en.json" class="urlextern" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/waldenn/conzept/master/app/explore2/assets/i18n/conzept-en.json" rel="ugc nofollow">English</a> locale to your new locale file and then make the translation changes for that locale.
</p>

<p>
Finally run “npm run build” to update the locale settings in the code base.
