<a href="https://conze.pt" class="urlextern" title="https://conze.pt" rel="ugc nofollow">Conzept</a> is an attempt (started in 2020) to create an encyclopedia for the 21st century. <strong>A modern topic-exploration tool based on Wikipedia, Wikidata, Open Library, Archive.org, GBIF, YouTube and other data sources.</strong>
</p>

<p>
Although Wikipedia is great and getting better all the time, I (Jama Poulsen) felt that the encyclopedic information could be presented better and have better integration with other major sources of information on the web. Each Wikipedia “article” actually relates to a multi-faceted concept, which we ideally should be able to easily explore. This is what Concept strives to be a good tool for. To help anyone to explore and learn about topics of their interest, in an effective and enjoyable way.
</p>

<p>
The three main goals of Conzept are:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> A more <strong>holistic presentation</strong> of the encyclopedic information contained within Wikipedia and Wikidata by integrating and linking with other information sources.</div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Significantly <strong>improving the user experience</strong> when taking in that wealth of information, by trying to reduce the cognitive-load and making the learning experience as fun and inspiring as possible.</div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> <strong>Innovate</strong> where possible _and_ useful, based on [Human-centered design](<a href="https://conze.pt/explore/Human-centered%20design?l=en&amp;t=wikipedia" class="urlextern" title="https://conze.pt/explore/Human-centered%20design?l=en&amp;t=wikipedia" rel="ugc nofollow">https://conze.pt/explore/Human-centered%20design?l=en&amp;t=wikipedia</a>) principles. This project is an ever-evolving tool, within an increasingly connected world of people and their creative works.</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Conzept works by using the Wikipedia and Wikidata <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>&#039;s to fetch the wiki-page and the metadata related to a topic. The wiki-page is then parsed, rearranged and presented in a cleaner design. Conzept detects the type of concept (person, location, event, organism, human work, etc.), to be able to display the most relevant associations for a topic. Conzept is multi-lingual (supporting ~300 languages) and has support for 10 different user-interface locales. Conzept makes learning about topics easier and more fun, due to its coherent workflow and third-party information integration, when studying subjects. Self-study and digital learning are becoming ever more important.

</p>

<p>
The layout of Conzept consists of two main areas: the <strong>sidebar</strong> and the <strong>content pane</strong>. Within both areas <strong>action buttons</strong> are used to trigger some kind of action for that topic.
</p>

<p>
From the sidebar you can:
</p>

<p>
*   Do a search using auto-complete and see the search results. More topics will be loaded in the sidebar as you scroll down to the bottom of the search results.
</p>

<p>
*   View lists related to a topic (eg. “view all dates within an article chronologically” or “view all inbound links”).
</p>

<p>
*   Manage bookmarks and notes (these are currently only stored in the browser, not on the server)
</p>

<p>
*   Change settings (language, locale, font, theme, voice, etc.)
</p>

<p>
*   Use additional tools (random topic, compare topics, ambient audio)
</p>

<p>
The content pane can consist of one or two sub-panes (depending on the content). <strong>The general workflow of all these panes is from left-to-right.</strong> So the sidebar directs the content pane. If the content pane has two sub-panes visible, the left sub-pane will direct the right sub-pane.
</p>

</p>

<p>
The action buttons allow for doing something with a topic, like eg. viewing videos or browsing books related to it. Each topic has a visible set of <strong>main actions buttons</strong> and a set of hidden <strong>categorized action buttons</strong>.
</p>

<p>
The main action buttons show the most common and essential buttons for a topic. Note that each topic has an <strong>“explore-this-topic” action button</strong>, which can be used to do a search for that particular topic string.
</p>

<p>
The categorized action buttons can be shown by clicking on the triangle symbol. These buttons are grouped by categories like: video, audio, art, science, biology and geography.
</p>

<p>
This concludes the introduction into the basic functions of Conzept. You should now be able to start exploring topics of your interest.
