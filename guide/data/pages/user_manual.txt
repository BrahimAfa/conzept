[{{::screenshot_from_2022-01-16_13-53-19.jpg?direct|search results page}}]

**[[https://conze.pt|Conzept]] is an attempt to create an [[explore>encyclopedia]] for the 21st century.**

A modern topic-exploration tool based on: [[explore>Wikipedia]], [[explore>Wikidata]], the [[explore>Open Library]], [[explore>Archive.org]], [[explore>YouTube]], the [[explore>Global Biodiversity Information Facility|GBIF]] and many other information sources. A [[explore>semantic web]] app build for: [[explore>fun]], [[explore>education]] and [[explore>research]].

Conzept allows you to explore any of the millions of topics on Wikipedia from many [[terms#topic_sections|different angles]], such as: science, art, digital books and education, both as a defined semantic entity ("thing") as well as a "string". Client-side [[topic classification|topic-classification]] in addition allows for a fast, higher-level logic throughout the whole user experience.

The integrated user-interface gives you a clean, well-designed view of all this information, in any of the [[explore>List of Wikipedias|300+ Wikipedia languages]], without "[[https://www.cmu.edu/news/stories/archives/2021/may/overcoming-tab-overload.html|tab overload]]".

The Conzept project is [[explore>free software]] licensed under the [[https://github.com/waldenn/conzept/blob/master/LICENSE|GNU General Public License version 3]] (unless noted otherwise in parts of the code and assets) and the development repository is hosted on [[https://github.com/waldenn/conzept/|GitHub]]. Development news is announced on [[https://twitter.com/conzept__|Twitter]].

===== project goals =====

{{ :logo.svg?200}}

Although Wikipedia is great and getting better all the time, I (Jama Poulsen) felt that the encyclopedic information could be presented better and have more integration with other major sources of information on the web.

Each Wikipedia "article" actually relates to a multi-faceted concept, which we ideally should be able to easily explore. This is what Conzept strives to be a good tool for. To help anyone to explore and learn about topics of their interest, in an effective and enjoyable way.

The main goals of Conzept are:

  * A more **holistic presentation of the encyclopedic information** contained within Wikipedia and Wikidata by integrating and linking with other information sources.

  * Significantly **improving the user experience** when taking in that wealth of information, by trying to reduce the cognitive-load and making the learning experience as fun and inspiring as possible.

  * **Innovate** where possible //and// useful, based on [[https://conze.pt/explore/Human-centered%20design?l=en&t=wikipedia|human-centered design]] principles. This project is an ever-evolving tool, within an increasingly digital, connected world of people and their creative works. 

  * Build the project as **free software** and make its use and development accessible for all. Find sustainable ways to support its maintenance, development and collaboration.

===== application layout =====

{{ :app_layout.svg?direct|}}

The layout of Conzept consists of two main areas:
  * The **[[#conzept sidebar|sidebar]]**, which is used for showing the [[#string search|search interface]], the language select and various tabs.

  * The **content area**, which consists of one or two **[[#content panes]]**. These panes are used to show [[apps|apps]] and (embeddable) websites.
==== conzept sidebar ====

[{{ :sidebar_screenshot_1.jpg?direct|sidebar example}}]

From the sidebar you can:

  * Click on the "conzept" name, to **clear the search query and return to the homescreen.** On the homescreen there are also various topicical links available.

  * <html><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i>&nbsp;</html> **Change the content language** to any of the ~300 Wikipedia-supported languages

    * More [[terms#topic_card|topics]] will be loaded in the sidebar as you scroll down to the bottom of the search results.

  * <html><i class="far fa-bookmark"></i>&nbsp;</html> **Manage your [[#bookmarks|bookmarks]]** in the bookmarks-tab
    * This allows for quick access to previously bookmarked topics.
    * You can bookmark a topic by clicking the bookmark-icon in the "main"-section of each topic.

  * <html><i class="fas fa-wrench"></i>&nbsp;</html> **Use additional tools** from the tools-tab, allowing you to:

    * Compare topics ([[https://conze.pt/explore/Trogon?l=en&t=compare&c=Q1268064,Q998535,Q1268477&s=true|example]])
    * Play ambient audio (which can help with focus)
    * Fullscreen the app
    * Bookmark the current URL
    * Clone the current tab

  * <html><i class="fas fa-cog"></i>&nbsp;</html> **Change the settings** in the [[#settings|settings-tab]].

  * <html><i class="fas fa-question"></i>&nbsp;</html> **See the documentation** in the help-tab.

==== content panes ====

[{{ ::content_panes_0.jpg?direct|single content-pane example ([[https://conze.pt/explore/Kazakhstan?l=en&t=link&i=Q232&u=%2Fapp%2Fmap%2F%3Fl%3Den%26bbox%3D67.95%2C47.95%2C68.05%2C48.05%26lat%3D48%26lon%3D68%26osm_id%3D214665%26qid%3D232%26title%3DKazakhstan&c=48,68&s=true|link]]) }}]

[{{ ::content_panes_2.jpg?direct|dual content-pane example ([[https://conze.pt/explore/Thirty%20Years'%20War?l=en&t=link-split&i=Q2487&u=https%3A%2F%2Fconze.pt%2Fapp%2Ftimespace%2F%3Fq%3DQ2487%26l%3Den%26highlight%3DQ2487%26limited%3Dfalse&s=true|link]]) }}]

[{{ ::content_panes_1.jpg?direct|another dual content-pane example ([[https://conze.pt/explore/Pythagorean%20theorem?l=en&t=link-split&i=Q11518&u=%2Fapp%2Flinks%2F%3Fl%3Den%26t%3DPythagorean%2520theorem&s=true|link]]) }}]

The content area can consist of one or two **content panes**, depending on the type of content being shown. **These panes are used to show [[apps|Conzept apps]] or (embeddable) websites.**

Some types of content (such as highly inter-related information displaying apps) can sometimes be presented better in a dual-pane view. Such a view can make it easier to browse lots of related objects. without losing the 'main thread'.

**The general workflow of these panes is always from left-to-right. So the sidebar directs the content pane.** If the content area has two content panes, the left pane will direct the right pane.

===== string search =====

{{ :search_1.jpg?direct|search suggestions}}

To find topics of your interest, you can enter a search string into the search bar.
While typing your string you will get back topic suggestions.

You can either select a topic suggestion or use your own search string.

The results will be shown in the sidebar and the next results are loaded once you scroll to the bottom of the results.

If your search-string does not directly match any Wikipedia article, there will be a [[terms#topic_card|topic card]] created from that "raw" search-string. This card will however lack all the Wikidata-related [[terms#topic_fields|topic fields]].
===== structured search =====

[{{ ::structured_query_1.jpg?direct|structured search query input}}]

[{{ ::structured_query_2.jpg?direct|structured query results ([[https://conze.pt/explore/?l=en&t=wikipedia&s=true&query=%7B%22conditions%22%3A%5B%7B%22propertyId%22%3A%22P31%22%2C%22propertyDataType%22%3A%22wikibase-item%22%2C%22propertyValueRelation%22%3A%22matching%22%2C%22referenceRelation%22%3A%22regardless%22%2C%22value%22%3A%22Q5%22%2C%22subclasses%22%3Atrue%2C%22conditionRelation%22%3Anull%2C%22negate%22%3Afalse%7D%2C%7B%22propertyId%22%3A%22P106%22%2C%22propertyDataType%22%3A%22wikibase-item%22%2C%22propertyValueRelation%22%3A%22matching%22%2C%22referenceRelation%22%3A%22regardless%22%2C%22value%22%3A%22Q36834%22%2C%22subclasses%22%3Atrue%2C%22conditionRelation%22%3A%22and%22%2C%22negate%22%3Afalse%7D%5D%2C%22limit%22%3A10%2C%22useLimit%22%3Atrue%2C%22omitLabels%22%3Afalse%7D|link]]) }}]

**Structured searching is an easy way to construct (simple) [[explore>SPARQL]]-queries and see the results in the sidebar.**

This functionality can be accessed by:

  - Clicking on the "structured search" detail-element in the topics-tab. \\ \\
  - Then define one or more sets of a requested **entity class** and/or an **[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Database_reports/List_of_properties/all|entity property]]** value. \\ \\
  - Then click the "run query" button. \\ \\
===== commands =====

[{{ :graph_command.jpg?direct|[[https://conze.pt/explore/!graph%20f(x,y)%20=%20sin(x*y)?l=en&t=link&u=%2Fapp%2Fxrgraph%2F%3Ffunction%3Df(x%2Cy)%2520%25253D%2520sin(x*y)&s=true|!graph example]]}}]

These are some (experimental) **!-prefixed commands** which, when entered into the search box, **override the normal search function.**

Overview of the current commands:

  * **[[https://conze.pt/explore/!graph%20f(x,y)%20=%20sin(x*y)?l=en&t=link&u=%2Fapp%2Fxrgraph%2F%3Ffunction%3Df(x%2Cy)%2520%25253D%2520sin(x*y)&s=true|!graph]]** - A function plotter command (with [[explore>WebXR]] support). (Note: It would be really wonderful if in the future this functionality could be extended to a mathematical environment being build, called [[https://github.com/sagemathinc/JSage|JSage]])

  * **[[https://conze.pt/explore/!check%20Caracas%20has%20a%20lot%20of%20crime?l=en|!check]]** - An AI-based fact-checking command.

===== bookmarks =====

[{{ ::bookmark_1.jpg?direct|adding a bookmark}}]

[{{ ::bookmark_2.jpg?direct|bookmark management from the bookmark-tab}}]

You can **bookmark topics** that you like, by opening the main-section of a topic, and then clicking on the <html>&nbsp;<i class="far fa-bookmark"></i>&nbsp;</html> icon.

To **view and manage your bookmarks**, click on the <html>&nbsp;<i class="far fa-bookmark"></i>&nbsp;</html> icon in the tab-menu.
From the bookmark manager you can delete and drag-and-drop the bookmarks into your own list hierarchies.

The bookmarks are only stored locally in the browser (using a browser cookie), and not on any server.

[ Note: There is currently no import / export functionality for bookmarks. ]

===== settings =====

[{{::settings.jpg?direct|settings tab}}]

The following settings are available:

  * Set the **font size**

  * Set the **font type**

  * Set the **interface language** (locale)
    * Note: This is different from the content-language setting. This //only// affects the Conzept UI interface.

  * Set the **theme** (light / dark mode, link previews, color filters)

  * Set **text-to-speech** settings (voice, speaking speed, speaking rate)

  * Set **persona-tags**
    * Note: This allows Conzept to better suite the user-interface to your needs. Eg. to show map links for hotels and walking-routes, for tourist-personas.
