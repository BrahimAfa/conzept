====== section customization ======

The content in [[terms#topic_card|topic-cards]] is organized using a tree-structure of [[terms#topic_sections|topic sections]].

The structure and names of these sections comes from the "**[[https://github.com/waldenn/conzept/blob/master/app/explore2/src/data/sections.js|src/data/sections.js]]**" file.

Each section can define the following fields:

^ name      ^ description       ^
| **ID** | ID-name, this is the section object-key by which the sections are processed in Conzept. This ID is also used for [[localization|localizing]] section names.|
| **icon** | Optional: Icon-classes, either taken from [[https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/icons?d=gallery|FontAwesome]] or from [[https://openmoji.org/library/|OpenMoji]]. |
| **sub** | Optional: Section-branch, which is used to define sub-sections within a section. Sections can have unlimited sub-sections. |

To add or remove sections, you edit the "sections.js" file as needed and execute "**npm run build**".

In [[field customization]] you can see how links can be added to these sections.

===== example =====

Below is a snippet from that file, showing the sections for: "main", "meta" and "media". The Conzept rendered output is shown next to it.
