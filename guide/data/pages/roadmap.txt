====== roadmap ======

===== specific ideas =====

  * Fix the items mentioned in **[[issues|issues]]**.

  * Create a **[[browser extension]]** for text-selection queries on 3rd party sites, by modifying the [[https://github.com/emvaized/selecton-extension|selecton extension]] (MIT license).

  * Add **claim-support** to the Wikidata-data fetching (and support for claim-data in the field-definitions).

  * Find and integrate a more lightweight MIDI-webcomponent ([[https://github.com/cifkao/html-midi-player|html-midi-player]] is more than 0.5MB by itself!)

  * Allow the user bookmarks to be imported & exported.

  * Support and document setting up Nginx as a webserver alternative for Apache2.
===== general ideas =====

  * Research **educational-support enhancements**:
    * Collaborative & social learning features (eg. [[https://jamshelf.com/|Jam]] audio-chat rooms for each topic)
    * User-created and auto-generated presentations around a topic
    * Auto-generated topic [[https://conze.pt/explore/Genre?l=en&t=link&i=Q483394&u=https%3A%2F%2Fconze.pt%2Fapp%2Fquiz%2F%3Fm%3Dlist%26q%3DQ3305213%26p%3DP136%26l%3Den&s=true|quizzes]]
    * Auto-generated, [[https://fs.blog/spacing-effect/|spaced-repetition]]-based facts learning (for a certain topic / set of topics / topic-domain)
    * Note-taking integration  (eg.: [[https://bangle.io/|Bangle]], ...)
    * Better ways to indicate personal and professional interests (similar to the persona-tags setting)

  * Allow 3rd-party SPARQL-based endpoints to be added as **extra "[[concept stores]]"** (besides Wikipedia & Wikidata).

  * **Offline(-first?) support** with content-caching (especially useful when traveling and/or without reliable internet-connectivity)

  * Look into integrating **[[explore>Solid (web decentralization project)|Solid]]** for user-authentication ([[explore>WebID]], [[explore>Decentralized identifier|DID]]) and user-data-storage (LoD pod) workflows. (How would offline work?)
