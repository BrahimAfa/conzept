====== roadmap ======

===== specific ideas =====

  * Fix the items mentioned in **[[issues|issues]]**.

  * Design a **[[command API]]** for scriptable entity-processing workflows. ''(partly done)''

  * Create a **[[browser extension]]** for text-selection queries on 3rd party sites and entity-linking via JSON-LD.  ''(work in progress)''

  * Create a **Docker image** (and Nix?) for the whole of Conzept (Apache webserver, static site tree, ~4 services, 1 config directory + config file, setup script, ...)

  * Support and document setting up **Nginx as a webserver** alternative for Apache2.

  * Add **claim-support** to the Wikidata-data fetching (and support for claim-data in the field-definitions).

  * Implement **bookmark imported & exporting**.

  * Add optional **geolocation-support**, so we could route a user from the current location to the location of a topic, using the [[https://twitter.com/conzept__/status/1490300622360518663|OSMR routing app]].

  * Find and integrate a **more lightweight MIDI-webcomponent**, if available ([[https://github.com/cifkao/html-midi-player|html-midi-player]] is more than 0.5MB by itself!)
===== general ideas =====

  * Allow 3rd-party SPARQL-based endpoints to be added as **extra "[[concept stores]]"** (besides Wikipedia & Wikidata).

  * Research **educational-support enhancements**:
    * Collaborative & social learning features (eg. [[https://github.com/lyricat/mornin.fm|p2p audio-chat]] and [[https://www.hyperhyperspace.org/|text-chat]] rooms for each topic)
    * User-created and auto-generated presentations around a topic
    * Auto-generated topic [[https://conze.pt/explore/Genre?l=en&t=link&i=Q483394&u=https%3A%2F%2Fconze.pt%2Fapp%2Fquiz%2F%3Fm%3Dlist%26q%3DQ3305213%26p%3DP136%26l%3Den&s=true|quizzes]]
    * Auto-generated, [[https://fs.blog/spacing-effect/|spaced-repetition]]-based facts learning (for a certain topic / set of topics / topic-domain)
    * ? Note-taking integration  (eg.: [[https://bangle.io/|Bangle]], ...)
    * Better ways to indicate personal and professional interests (similar to the persona-tags setting)
    * Experiences: play Chess positions (done), ...

  * ? Offline(-first) support with content-caching (especially useful when traveling and/or without reliable internet-connectivity)

  * ? Research creating some kind of a simple web-application interface standard for input/output/event-handling:
    * URL parameter IO (iso2 language, search-string, ID, ...)
    * Event-handling (other view triggers, key-bindings, fullscreening, ...)
