====== datasources ======

(TODO: Document how the datasources system works and how it can be configured. Show the steps for a simple datasource integration.)


The idea is to **allow any REST or SPARQL API to be added to a Conzept system** and render topics in the sidebar.

Features:
  * Make adding a new datasource as easy as possible, but still flexible in terms of the rendered output.
  * Make the API search results show up in the same style and results paging mechanics, as the other datasources.
  * Let the topic results be augmented from Wikidata, if a Qid for the topic is provided.
  * Have auto-completion work too (if wanted and possible).
  * Allow the user to choose which datasources to use.

===== use cases =====

  * **Allow for adding extra "data sources" to a Conzept system**, so other concepts - beyond Wikipedia and Wikidata - can also be presented.
  *  **Any organization that wants to use the Conzept user-interface for showing and augmenting their own knowledge base.**

==== status ====

[{{::datasources.jpg?direct|datasources options for the user}}]

  * The **[[datasources]]** system is now somewhat working (configuration example: **[[https://conze.pt/app/explore2/src/data/datasources.js|src/data/datasources.js]]**), with these remaining issues:
    * BUG: There is a paging logic bug in the current code, which needs to be found and fixed.
    * BUG: Indicate when there are "no results found" for a search, or when a datasource is "unreachable"
    * Cleanup the access function API (see the "technical roadmap" notes below)

  * Technical roadmap:
    * Research how to further **generalize the datasource integration**, using the common result-format used on Conzept (based on the Wikipedia API result structure)
    * Add hooks for pre- and post-processing of the API data.
    * Add hooks to enrich the API data (with Wikipedia and Wikidata information)
    * Test the datasource system on other real datasources (Sparql and REST).
    * Allow for datasource activation via an URL parameter (so these searches can be linked to) and store these in a cookie.

==== adding a new datasource ====

  - Add the new datasource to the datasource-configuration file here: [[https://conze.pt/app/explore2/src/data/datasources.js|src/data/datasources.js]]
  - Add a new datasource directory (using the name of the datasource, eg. "gleif")
  - Add a new JS file in that directory, implementing the required API access functions, example: [[https://conze.pt/app/explore2/src/datasources/gleif/index.js|src/datasources/gleif/index.js]]
