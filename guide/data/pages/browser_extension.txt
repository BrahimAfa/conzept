====== browser extension ======

''(work in progress)''

The **Conzept browser extension** is a (lightly-patched) fork of the great [[https://github.com/fuddl/wd|Wikidata-for-Web extension]].

This extension allows you to:

  * **Text-selection search**: Select some text on any website, then __right-click for the context-menu__ , which will show an option to search on Conzept. Even browser-viewed PDF files are supported!

  * Detect and **see the semantic metadata** on (supported) websites, in a sidebar panel. This works through Wikidata-based URL-matching and by checking the website for embedded metadata (meta-tags, JSON-LD).

===== install =====

* **[[https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/conzept-encyclopedia-extension/|Firefox version]]**

* **Chrome version** (soon)
