====== localization ======

[{{ ::german_view.jpg?direct|Conzept in German}}]

Most of the Conzept interface can be localized, these parts include main UI elements such as menu labels and the topic-card section names. Conzept has basic support for right-to-left scripts such as Arabic.

The list of supported locales can be found in the Conzept settings file (look for the "CONZEPT_LOCALES" setting).

If you want to add a new locale to Conzept:

  - Add the locale to the "CONZEPT_LOCALES" setting in the Conzept settings file. \\ \\
  - Add a the new locale file to the "[[https://github.com/waldenn/conzept/tree/master/app/explore2/assets/i18n|app/explore2/assets/i18n]]" directory. The easiest way to do this is to copy the [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/waldenn/conzept/master/app/explore2/assets/i18n/conzept-en.json|english]] locale to your new locale file and then make the translation changes needed for that locale. \\ \\
  - Finally run "npm run build" to rebuild Conzept.

Optional: It would be very nice to file an issue or pull-request on the [[https://github.com/waldenn/conzept|GitHub repo]] for this new translation file!
