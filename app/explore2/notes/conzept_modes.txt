-------------------

  - string search

  - structured search (via a SPARQL web-client)

  - random drop
    - topic (very broad)
    - randomized "most popular article (from last month)"
    - artist + artwork (narrow)
    - composer + music file (narrow)
    - TO EXPLORE: user-defined topic-class
    - ...

  - TO RESEARCH: offline-mode content viewing

RESULT PHASE:

  - read / listen topic
  - deeplinks from the topic-card (topic properties, topic category, 3rd-party links)
  - explore topic --> triggers: string search
  - topical overviews
    - eg. for events --> timespace tool
    - eg. anatomy hierarchy tool
  - TO IMPROVE: --> similar topics
  - TO EXPLORE: triggers into structured-queries 
  - TO EXPLORE: topic presentations
  - TO EXPLORE: recommendations based on:
    - user defined topics
    - user defined tags
    - bookmarks
    - page visit history (including time spend on page)
    - ...

JOURNEY RECALL:

  - browser bookmarks
  - conzept bookmarks
  - TOFIX: conzept URL-history navigation
