concept usage modes
-------------------

INITIAL PHASE:

  - string search

  - structured search (using a SPARQL-query)

  - random drop
    - topic (very broad)
    - randomized "most popular article (from last month)"
    - artist + artwork (narrow)
    - composer + music file (narrow)
    - TO EXPLORE: user-defined topic-class
    - ...

  - content link
    - news page (dynamic)
    - top XYZ pages (static) (TO EXPLORE: dynamically generated top-pages)

  - world-analog input:
    - image         -> OCR + named-entity detection (currently disabled)
    - image         -> bird detection (currently disabled)
    - GPS position  -> TODO: ...

  - TO RESEARCH: offline-mode content viewing

RESULT PHASE:

  - read / listen topic
  - deeplinks from the topic-card (topic properties, topic category, 3rd-party links)
  - explore topic --> triggers: string search
  - topical overviews
    - eg. for events --> timespace tool
    - eg. anatomy hierarchy tool
  - triggers into structured-queries  (topic classification link)
  - presentations
  - experiences
    - gamified challenges (explore challenges in domain, quiz about a topic/domain)
      - chess problems
      - geo-location guessing quiz)
      - ?body browser -> find a body part
    - social interactions (discussion, QA, presenting, etc.)
    - offline-world application
  - TO IMPROVE: --> similar topics
  - TO EXPLORE: recommendations based on:
    - user defined topics
    - user defined tags
    - bookmarks
    - page visit history (including time spend on page)
    - ...

JOURNEY RECALL:

  - browser bookmarks
  - conzept bookmarks
  - TOFIX: conzept URL-history navigation
  - TO EXPLORE: note-taking integration
