It is a common misconception that the animals assigned by year are the only signs, and many Western descriptions of Chinese astrology draw solely on this system. In fact, there are also animal signs assigned by month (called inner animals), by day and hours (called secret animals). The Earth is all 12 signs, 5 seasons.",
